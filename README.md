# SwitchScores browser extension

This is a browser extension for [Switch Scores](https://www.switchscores.com/). It has been tested under Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

It adds some meta-informations extracted from Switch Scores into the Nintendo game page: score, reviews, genre, series, and tags.

Now it's easier than ever to check if a heavily discounted game is shovelware or a hidden gem!
